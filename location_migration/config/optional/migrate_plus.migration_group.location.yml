# migrations in the group. For this example, the source tables are in the
# Drupal (default) database, but usually if your source data is in a
# database it will be external.

  # Specifying 'source' here means that this configuration will be merged into
  # the 'source' configuration of each migration.

    # A better practice for real-world migrations would be to add a database
    # connection to your external database in settings.php and reference its
    # key here.
